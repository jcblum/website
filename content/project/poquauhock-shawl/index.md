# Inspiration

This shawl is for my grandmother. I wanted it to connect to three things:

* Purple (her favorite color); specifically, the range of purples you see in sea-worn pieces of [quahog][quahog] shell ([hence the project name][clamname]). As kids, we would collect these "grandma shells" by the dozen, and proudly present them to her to be kept in a vase in the kitchen window.
* The Atlantic beach where my grandparents have spent their summers for the last four decades, and the setting for some of my favorite memories of time spent together
* Her taste: modern, unfussy, elegant

I spent a couple of years mulling over ideas for how to capture these elements (some of the mulling wound up in [this bundle][bundle]), but in the end it all came together pretty serendipitously!

First, Hilary Smith Callis published her wonderful Pennae pattern, and I knew immediately it was what I'd been looking for: it reminded me of waves lapping the shore and the layers of color in the "grandma shells". The asymmetrical shape and simple design was just the balance of modern minimalism and femininity that I thought would suit my grandmother's taste.

Then, out of the blue, my (non-knitter) mother e-mailed to say that she'd heard about this Baltimore yarn company selling a special colorway to benefit some very worthy community groups and would I like some? (Um, YES — it's Neighborhood Fiber Co, already a fave of mine).

The yarn arrives and lo and behold, the colorway is the *perfect* mix of gorgeous purples, and the yarn's origin adds another layer of meaning to the gift: my grandmother spent 30 years teaching in the Baltimore City public schools and the cause this yarn benefits is close to her heart. Honestly, I got a little teary when I saw this yarn.

Finally, I found the perfect sand/shell-neutral and creamy seafoam-white sitting in my stash, so all I had to do was knit!

# Pattern

A joy to knit, and easy enough to memorize that I was able to make it my commute-knitting — so it went pretty fast!

I didn't bother to measure gauge _because shawl_, but I think mine came out a bit smaller than called for (I have found in the past that I need to go up needle sizes to match gauge from this designer). This wasn't a problem, since my grandmother is a petite person — I don't have a photo (yet), but the shawl fits her beautifully.
